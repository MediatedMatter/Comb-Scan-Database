---Introduction---
This repository contains micro-CT scanned electron density data from honeybee comb in the form of image stacks. 
These image stacks can be reconstructed into volumetric data using the open-source software 3D Slicer.
This data has been down-sampled to reduce its size, and the pixel values have been adjusted for visibility. 
To request the original datasets, please contact nah6cz@mit.edu.

---Dataset Notes---
We have made the CT scan datasets shown here available to the public in the form of 32 bit TIFF image stacks stored in an open repository. 
Each hive was cultivated in Cambridge, Massachusetts between the months of February and October of 2020. 
Colonies were provided with supplemental nutrition in the form of sugar syrup and synthetic pollen during the fall in order to encourage comb production. 
All acrylic containers were placed atop established colonies housed within 1 to 2 brood chambers and 1 to 2 supers and covered with an external box to create a dark, enclosed environment. 
Queens were temporarily relocated to the acrylic environment to encourage integration with the hive. 
After the acrylic environment was accepted by the hive, the queen was relocated to the brood chambers and prevented from entering the acrylic environment through the use of a queen excluder. 
Descriptions of each hive are included below and pictured in Figure S2. 

Hive Au - Gold
Hive Au was cultivated in a 27 cm x 27 cm x 27 cm acrylic cube with an acrylic crossbar spanning two axes. 
Wax foundation was attached to the acrylic crossbar using metal screws, which read as highly electron-dense, and therefore bright, regions in the CT scans. 
Supplemental wax blended with gold nanoparticles were placed at the hive’s entrance which, when incorporated into the comb, altered the color of the built comb. 
The acrylic container for hive Au was periodically rotated to induce perturbations in comb morphology.  

Hive Ag - Silver
Hive Ag was cultivated in a 27 cm x 27 cm x 27 cm acrylic cube with an acrylic crossbar spanning two axes, identical to that of Au. 
Wax foundation was attached to the acrylic crossbar using metal screws. Supplemental wax blended with silver nanoparticles were placed at the hive’s entrance, causing comb to take on a grey color. 
The acrylic container was periodically rotated to induce perturbations in comb morphology.  

Hive Con - Control
Hive Con was cultivated in a 27 cm x 27 cm x 27 cm acrylic cube with an acrylic crossbar spanning two axes, serving as a control for the hives fed with metal nanoparticles. 
Wax foundation was attached to the acrylic crossbar using metal screws. Supplemental wax was placed at the hive’s entrance without any additives. 
The acrylic container was periodically rotated to induce perturbations in comb morphology.  

Hive F - Fracture
Hive F was cultivated in a 15 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm acrylic cube with a 3D printed, highly curved substrate serving as the roof of the cube. 
The 3D printed substrate was fabricated using Vero-Clear resin and a Stratasys J750 3D printer and was coated with melted beeswax prior to placement in the hive.  
During comb construction, the central region of wax was fractured. 
This was later repaired by the hive through the joining of a section built from the environment’s base with the previous build extending from the 3D printed substrate. 
Hive F contains no metal parts, and therefore may be better suited for density analysis.

Wild Comb Samples (WC 1-4)
In addition to the cultivated hives discussed in this publication, we have included several CT scanned datasets of comb constructed by wild or feral honeybees. 
These samples were obtained by Super Bee Rescue in Santa Barbara, California when the colonies that constructed them were relocated. All four samples were collected from various hives built within trees.
